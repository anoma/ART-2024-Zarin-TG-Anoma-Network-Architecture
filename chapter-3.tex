% Help the reader grasp the conceptual framework within which the design and analysis takes place. By doing so, we provide a foundational (perhaps mathematical) understanding for the rest of the sections. Note that parts of this chapter can be copied from our P2P paper and from Anoma's architecture 1 sections in the specs. 
\section{System Model}

% Introduce the main networking (perhaps mathematical) assumptions, some of which are mentioned by Chris in TGs forum post. 
\subsection{Network Model}

% Introduce the assumed attacker model. 
\subsection{Threat Model}

% Outline the main system goals which should naturally produce requirements in the next section.
