\section{Design Requirements}
% Based on what we learned from previous chapter about Anoma, we can deduce the most important requirements for its network and software architecture


\subsection{P2P Network Architecture Requirements}

% what our network architecture must accomplish
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}


% how it must be accomplished (from quality perspective)
\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}


\subsection{P2P Software Architecture Requirements}


% what our software architecture must accomplish
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}


% how it must be accomplished (from quality perspective)
\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
