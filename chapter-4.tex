% Based on what we learned from previous two chapters, we can define the most important requirements for Anoma's network and software architecture. 
% We can also indicate the priority and provide a rationale for each requirement (for people that do not have the right context to understand the why). 
\section{Design Requirements}


\subsection{P2P Network Architecture Requirements}

% Explain what our network architecture must accomplish. For example, nodes must be able to broadcast a message. 
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}


% Explain how it must be accomplished (from quality perspective). For example, broadcasting must be low-latency. 
\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}


\subsection{P2P Software Architecture Requirements}


% For example, nodes must be able to express their preferences.
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}


% For example, the addressing scheme must be modular. 
\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
